## ⚠️ The Fine Print  
WinAntidote is a recovery champ, not a virus hunter. It fixes the mess malware leaves behind but won’t remove the culprits. After running it, grab an antivirus (like Windows Defender or Malwarebytes) to finish the job. Use it wisely — it’s a powerful tool, but I’m not liable if you accidentally turn your PC into a toaster. (Kidding — it’s safe as houses.)
